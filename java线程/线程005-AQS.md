### 获取执行资格

```java
 public final void acquireShared(int arg) {
        if (tryAcquireShared(arg) < 0)
            doAcquireShared(arg);
    }
```

#### doAcquireShared(arg) 方法分析

```java
private void doAcquireShared(int arg) {
        final Node node = addWaiter(Node.SHARED);
        boolean failed = true;
        try {
            boolean interrupted = false;

                    int r = tryAcquireShared(arg);
                    if (r >= 0) {
                        setHeadAndPropagate(node, r);
                        p.next = null; // help GC
                        if (interrupted)
                            selfInterrupt();
                        failed = false;
                        return;
                    }
                }

            }
        } finally {
            if (failed)
                cancelAcquire(node);
        }
    }
 private void setHeadAndPropagate(Node node, int propagate) {
        Node h = head; // Record old head for check below
        setHead(node);
        /*
         * Try to signal next queued node if:
         *   Propagation was indicated by caller,
         *     or was recorded (as h.waitStatus either before
         *     or after setHead) by a previous operation
         *     (note: this uses sign-check of waitStatus because
         *      PROPAGATE status may transition to SIGNAL.)
         * and
         *   The next node is waiting in shared mode,
         *     or we don't know, because it appears null
         *
         * The conservatism in both of these checks may cause
         * unnecessary wake-ups, but only when there are multiple
         * racing acquires/releases, so most need signals now or soon
         * anyway.
         */
        if (propagate > 0 || h == null || h.waitStatus < 0 ||

         * Ensure that a release propagates, even if there are other
         * in-progress acquires/releases.  This proceeds in the usual
         * way of trying to unparkSuccessor of head if it needs
         * signal. But if it does not, status is set to PROPAGATE to
         * ensure that upon release, propagation continues.
         * Additionally, we must loop in case a new node is added
         * while we are doing this. Also, unlike other uses of
         * unparkSuccessor, we need to know if CAS to reset status
         * fails, if so rechecking.
         */

```

### 释放执行资格

```java
 public final boolean releaseShared(int arg) {
        if (tryReleaseShared(arg)) {
            doReleaseShared();
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
```
